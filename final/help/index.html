				<h2>Projects</h2>
				<p>The information system's fundamental unit of information is the project. A project represents a product or service in development, and provides a group of functionalities to help manage the team working on it and track progress along a series of individual tasks and milestones comprising a series of tasks. Aditionally it facilitates team communication through a forum.</p>
				<h3>Adding and removing team members</h3>
				<p>A newly created project has only one user account associated to it: its creator. More team members can be added to the project by accessing the <strong>Member</strong> tab and searching for the person you want to add in the search field. After identifiying the team member to add to the project she or he can be added by pressing the <strong>Add to project</strong> button.</p>
				<p> A team member can be removed by pressing the <strong>Remove</strong> button alongside his name on the member management interface. Please note that Team Coordinators cannot be removed from the project and need to be demoted first.</p>
				<h3>Privilege Levels</h3>
				<dl class="dl-horizontal">
					<dt>Member</dt>
					<dd>Default access level for newly added team members, this allows them to create and participate in tasks and threads.</dd><dt></dt><dd> Demote a Team Coordinator to this status by pressing the <strong>Demote</strong> button next to his name on the member management interface.</dd>
					<dt>Coordinator</dt>
					<dd>Privileged access level, default access for creators. This privilege level has full control over the project and can add, promote and demote team members, delete tasks, threads and comments therein and assign, reassing or unassign tasks.</dd><dt></dt><dd>Promote a team member to this status by pressing the <strong>Promote</strong> button next to his name on the member management interface.</dd>
				</dl>
				<h2>Tasks</h2>
				<p> A task represents a particular goal or issue that needs to be executed or fixed by the team. As a Member or Coordinator of a project you can view and create new issues by accessing the <strong>Tasks</strong> tab on the project main page.</p>
				<h3>Viewing and filtering tasks</h3>
				<p> The task interface presents you with a list of tasks and labels in the project. Each task can have one or more labels associated with it. <strong>Filter</strong> the task list by clicking on a label on the list. This will hide all tasks who do not have that label assigned to them.</p>
				<p>To view a particular task simply click on it. You will be brought to the task page, where information about the task in question is displayed. Here you can view and, if you are a Coordinator, manage the current assignee, tasklist and labels associated with the project. Additionally a list of comments pertaining the topic are displayed, which can be deleted by Coordinators. Any member can leave a new comment by filling in the form at the bottom of the page</p>
				<h3>Task assignee and completion</h3>
				<p> When a task is created it is not assigned to anyone and is marked as incomplete. A Coordinator can assign tasks to any member of the project, at which point this information shall be displayed on the task page. When the assignee completes the task he can report this by creating a comment describing his solution to the problem and ticking the <strong>Mark as complete</strong> box. The task will then be marked as complete, though a Coordinator can reopen it in the future and assign it to someone else</p>
				<p> Manage task assignment by clicking on the <strong>gear</strong> in the sidebar, in the <strong>Assignee</strong> section.</p>
				<h2>Tasklist</h2>
				<p> A set of tasks pertaining to a particular project milestone can be grouped together under a tasklist. Tasklists can be managed from the <strong>Tasklist</strong> tab in the project page. To add a new tasklist to the project press the <strong>Add Task List</strong> button and filling in the form.</p>
				<p> Progress on a tasklist can be tracked by visiting the <strong>Tasklist</strong> tab in the project page and clicking on a tasklist. The tasks assigned to that tasklist will then expand and be visible below the tasklist progress bar.</p>
				<p> A task can be assigned to at most one tasklist. Manage task assignment by visiting the task in question and pressing the <strong>gear</strong> in the sidebar, next to the Tasklist section. Press <strong>Assign</strong> next to any of the tasklists listed to assign this task to that tasklist (and remove it from the tasklist it belongs to currently, if any), or <strong>Unassign</strong> to remove it from the current task list</p>
				<h2>Threads</h2>
				<p> Threads are discussion topics partaining to a particular subject. Anyone can comment on a thread or open a new thread. Coordinators can also delete, lock and assign labels to threads.</p>
				<h3>Viewing threads</h3>
				<p> The thread interface presents you with a list of threads and labels in the project. Each thread can have one or more labels associated with it. <strong>Filter</strong> the thread list by clicking on a label on the list. This will hide all threads who do not have that label assigned to them.</p>
				<p><em>For a description of how labels work please refer to the <a href="#task">Task</a> section.</em></p>
				<h3>Locking threads</h3>
				A Coordinator can lock a thread so that no further discussion can happen on it. To do so visit the thread page and press the <strong>Lock thread</strong> button. The action can be undone by pressing the <strong>Unlock thread</strong> button on the locked thread.</p>
